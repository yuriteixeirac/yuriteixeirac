I'm a student, currently trying to learn many things from **back-end** development down to the functioning of general purpose computers. Currently focusing on understanding the development of distributed systems and how to assemble non-centralized applications.

Seeking knowledge, recognition and a crowd to build upon, contributing not only to my own development, but to a community, which tends to keep me motivated.
